# Failure of Simultaneity
*Measured apart, felt together.*

Across the fabric of spacetime, something began to accelerate—
interactions settling into orbit,
collapsing distance into convergence.
Time refused to align,
and through the quantum stillness in between,
you exerted a gravitational pull—distant, yet inevitable,
a light drawn past the point of escape.
