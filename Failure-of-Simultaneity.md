# Failure of Simultaneity
*Measured apart, felt together.*

![Failure of Simultaneity](./failure-of-simultaneity.png)

Across the fabric of spacetime, something began to accelerate—<br>
interactions settling into orbit,<br>
collapsing distance into convergence.<br>
Time refused to align,<br>
and through the quantum stillness in between,<br>
you exerted a gravitational pull—distant, yet inevitable,<br>
a light drawn past the point of escape.
