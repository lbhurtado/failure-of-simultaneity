### Image Description

This image is rendered from a distant frame of reference. Across a quiet field of spacetime, curvature is present but unannounced, drawing paths inward without spectacle or emphasis. Light bends gently, not in resistance, but in accordance with geometry.

There is no visible threshold, no moment of collapse, no point at which change declares itself. Influence persists without urgency, and motion continues without awareness of binding. What appears ordinary from this frame conceals a structure that has already begun to converge.

The scene records condition rather than event: gravity as background, distance as legible, and capture as something that does not require recognition.
