## Image Description

The image presents a distant black hole suspended in deep space, its gravity bending light into a luminous ring at the edge of disappearance. A thin arc of light stretches outward from the event horizon, caught in the moment before escape—pulled, distorted, yet still visible to a distant observer.

Above and slightly offset, the **Cepheus constellation** is rendered with deliberate clarity. Its stars are connected not as decoration, but as reference points—markers of orientation in an otherwise unfixed cosmos. Cepheus stands as a frame of reference: distant, stable, and humanly comprehensible against the immeasurable force below.

The composition emphasizes scale and asymmetry. The black hole dominates the lower field, absorbing space and certainty, while Cepheus remains untouched—its geometry intact, its distance preserved. Light bridges the two only partially, never arriving, never fully departing.

This is not an image of collision or union, but of influence across separation.  
A visual meditation on gravity, observation, and inevitability—on what can be measured apart, yet still felt together.
