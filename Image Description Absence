## Image Study: Absence (Failure of Simultaneity)

This image is conceived as a study in absence rather than depiction.

The scene presents a transit space immediately after an event has passed: an empty ferry dock at night, lights still on, water undisturbed. Nothing is in motion. No figures are present. The environment continues as if uninterrupted, yet the sense of a recent crossing remains implicit.

The composition emphasizes geometry, distance, and waiting. Meaning is carried not by action, but by what has already occurred and is no longer visible. The space holds residue rather than narrative.

This image does not illustrate the poem or the story. It observes the same condition from another frame of reference: influence without announcement, consequence without spectacle.

Like the text, it is written in observation, not arrival.
